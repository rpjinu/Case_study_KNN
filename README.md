#Problem Statement:-
One of the companies maintains a database of the employees and their details. Based on this dataset the requirememt is to create the classification model using K Nearest Neighbour to predict if the employee will leave the company or not (attrition rate). There are around 1400+ records using this we need to create the model after breaking the data into test and train.
